## PROFILE

A fresh graduate in Informatics Engineering from Telkom University, completing the program in 3.5 years with a GPA of 3.68. I merge technical discipline with strategic business acumen. Specialize in the intersection of Software Engineering and Data Science. With a strong command of Full-Stack technologies (React, Node.js) and Data Analytics (Python, SQL, Tableau), I don't just build applications; I engineer intelligent systems. My active involvement in capital markets allows me to apply these skills in high-stakes environments, using machine learning to drive investment strategies. I am positioned to deliver immediate value: combining the technical depth of an engineer with the analytical precision of a data scientist and the strategic foresight of an investor.
